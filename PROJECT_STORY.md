# Leisure Navigator: Our BeaverHacks 2025 Journey

## Inspiration

The idea for Leisure Navigator was born from our own frustrations with planning leisure activities. We realized that while there are many apps for specific activities like restaurant reservations or museum tickets, there wasn't a comprehensive solution that brought everything together with AI-enhanced recommendations and detailed information.

As busy professionals and students, we often found ourselves spending hours researching places to visit, only to discover upon arrival that the information online was outdated or incomplete. We wanted to create a tool that not only helps users discover new places but provides them with comprehensive, accurate, and enhanced information about each location.

## What We Learned

Throughout the development of Leisure Navigator, we gained valuable insights into:

- **Integrating multiple APIs**: We learned how to effectively combine Google Maps, Places, Custom Search, and GROQ APIs to create a rich user experience with detailed information about activities.

- **AI enhancement**: Working with GROQ's LLM API taught us how to leverage AI to enhance content and provide more valuable information to users without requiring manual curation.

- **User-centered design**: We discovered the importance of creating intuitive interfaces that adapt to different user needs and preferences, particularly focusing on accessibility and dark mode support.

- **Next.js app architecture**: We deepened our understanding of modern React patterns, server-side rendering, and API route implementation within the Next.js framework.

## How We Built It

### Technology Stack

Leisure Navigator was built using a modern tech stack:

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, React 18, Tailwind CSS for styling
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes, Firebase for authentication and data storage
- **APIs**: Google Maps Platform (Maps, Places APIs), Google Custom Search, GROQ API
- **Deployment**: Google Cloud Platform (App Engine/Cloud Run)

### Development Process

1. **Planning Phase**: We started with wireframing and user flow diagrams to establish the core functionality and user experience.

2. **Core Features Implementation**: We developed the discover page with activity browsing, search functionality, and the ability to view detailed information about each activity.

3. **AI Enhancement**: We integrated GROQ's API to enhance descriptions and provide web search summaries about activities, giving users more comprehensive information.

4. **UI/UX Refinement**: We focused on making the interface intuitive, visually appealing, and accessible in both light and dark modes.

5. **Testing & Iteration**: We continuously tested the application, gathering feedback and making improvements to the user experience.

## Challenges We Faced

### Technical Challenges

- **Data Integration**: Harmonizing data from different APIs (Google Places, Maps, Custom Search) with varying formats and response structures was challenging.

- **TypeScript Configuration**: We encountered issues with TypeScript compatibility, particularly with modern JavaScript features like spread operators on Set objects, which required careful refactoring.

- **Performance Optimization**: Balancing rich content with performance was challenging, especially when displaying multiple images and API-enhanced descriptions.

- **API Rate Limiting**: Working within the constraints of API rate limits while still providing comprehensive information required clever caching strategies.

### Design Challenges

- **Information Hierarchy**: Presenting complex information about activities in an easy-to-digest format without overwhelming users required multiple redesigns.

- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring the UI worked well across all device sizes while maintaining visual appeal and functionality was a constant challenge.

- **Dark Mode Implementation**: Creating a cohesive dark mode experience that maintained visual contrast and readability across all components required careful attention to detail.

## What's Next for Leisure Navigator

Looking ahead, we plan to:

- Expand the recommendation system with more personalized suggestions based on user preferences and history
- Integrate more sources of activity information for even richer details
- Add social features to allow users to share favorite places and recommendations
- Implement calendar integration for better activity planning
- Develop a mobile app version for on-the-go access
