# Leisure Navigator Project Overview

## 1. Introduction

**Leisure Navigator** is a multimodal leisure discovery application designed to help users find engaging activities and events around them. By leveraging Google's innovative APIs (Maps, Calendar, Places, Vision, and Speech-to-Text) together with a headless CMS and GROQ for content querying, the app delivers real-time, personalized recommendations based on the user's location, preferences, and context.

## 2. Problem Statement

Many people struggle to identify leisure activities that match their interests and available time. Existing solutions often provide static lists with minimal personalization. Leisure Navigator addresses this gap by offering a dynamic and interactive experience that adapts to individual users using multimodal inputs.

## 3. Goals & Objectives

- **Personalization:** Provide tailored recommendations using user data and context.
- **Multimodal Interaction:** Allow users to interact via text, voice, and image inputs.
- **Context Awareness:** Leverage location data (via Google Maps and Places) to deliver real-time suggestions.
- **Integration with Google Ecosystem:** Sync events with Google Calendar and use Cloud Vision/Speech-to-Text for processing images and voice commands.
- **Rapid MVP Delivery:** Focus on delivering core functionality within a 24-hour hackathon timeframe with clear future enhancement paths.

## 4. Key Features

- **Leisure Activity Discovery:**  
  – Search and filter leisure activities by type, location, time, and reviews.  
  – Use a headless CMS (e.g., Sanity) with GROQ queries to efficiently retrieve content.

- **Multimodal Input Processing:**  
  – **Text Input:** Query leisure activities via typed questions.  
  – **Voice Input:** Use Google Cloud Speech-to-Text to allow hands-free queries.  
  – **Image Recognition:** Use Google Cloud Vision API to interpret images (e.g., flyers or local scenes) and extract relevant information.

- **Location-Based Services:**  
  – Integrate Google Maps and Places API to display activities near the user and enable geo-fencing notifications.

- **Calendar Integration:**  
  – Sync events with Google Calendar to help users manage their leisure time efficiently.

- **Personalization & Recommendations:**  
  – Analyze user behavior and context to generate customized activity suggestions.

- **Scalability & Deployment:**  
  – Deployed entirely on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using Cloud Run/App Engine, Cloud Functions, and Firestore.

- **MCP Integration (Optional Advanced Feature):**  
  – Configure a GitHub MCP server or add workspace rules so Windsurf can fetch additional context from your GitHub repository. This enables the AI to use your own libraries and documentation in its code generation and suggestions.

## 5. Technology Stack

- **Frontend:**  
  – Next.js (React) with TypeScript  
  – Tailwind CSS for styling  
  – Deployed on GCP (via Cloud Run or App Engine)

- **Backend & APIs:**  
  – Google Cloud Functions for serverless endpoints  
  – Firebase Firestore for real-time data and user session management  
  – Integration with Google Maps, Places, Calendar, Vision, and Speech-to-Text APIs  
  – Headless CMS (e.g., Sanity) with GROQ for content management

- **MCP & GitHub Integration (Advanced):**  
  – Option to set up a GitHub MCP server to allow Windsurf to fetch context from your GitHub repository  
  – Workspace rules (via a `.windsurfrules` file) to reference your GitHub repo URL if you prefer a lightweight setup

## 6. System Architecture

1. **User Interaction Layer:**  
   – Users interact via a clean UI built with Next.js that supports text, voice, and image inputs.  
   – The app displays interactive maps and event details.

2. **API & Integration Layer:**  
   – Google APIs provide real-time data (location, events, calendar updates, image and voice processing).  
   – The headless CMS holds curated leisure activity content queried via GROQ.

3. **Backend Services:**  
   – GCP Cloud Functions handle business logic and API requests.  
   – Firestore stores dynamic user data and interaction logs.

4. **Deployment & Scalability:**  
   – Containerized Next.js app deployed on Cloud Run or App Engine ensures fast loading times and global delivery.  
   – Monitoring through GCP Cloud Monitoring ensures performance and security.

5. **Optional MCP Integration:**  
   – A GitHub MCP server (or workspace rule) connects Windsurf to your GitHub repository so the AI can incorporate context from your own libraries.

## 7. Workflow & Development Timeline (24-Hour MVP)

### **Hours 1-2: Setup & Planning**
- Finalize project scope, create wireframes, and outline user journeys.
- Set up the GCP project, enable necessary APIs, and configure Firebase Firestore.

### **Hours 2-5: Frontend Development**
- Scaffold a new Next.js project and build essential pages (Home, Search Results, Details).
- Integrate Tailwind CSS and set up Google Maps for displaying leisure spots.

### **Hours 5-9: Backend & API Integration**
- Develop serverless endpoints with Cloud Functions to handle API calls.
- Integrate Google APIs (Maps, Places, Calendar, Vision, Speech-to-Text) and set up GROQ queries for the headless CMS.
- (Optional) Configure MCP integration for GitHub context:
  - Clone and configure a GitHub MCP server.
  - Add an entry in your `mcp_config.json` for the GitHub MCP server.

### **Hours 9-13: Multimodal Features & Core Functionality**
- Implement text search for leisure activities.
- Prototype voice and image input handling (if time permits, or stub out these features).
- Test the integrated system with mock data.

### **Hours 13-16: UI/UX Refinement & Testing**
- Refine the interface for intuitive multimodal interaction.
- Test error handling and ensure all integrations (APIs, Firestore, MCP) function as expected.

### **Hours 16-20: Deployment & Final Testing**
- Containerize and deploy the Next.js app on GCP using Cloud Run or App Engine.
- Perform final testing on responsiveness, performance, and security.
- Verify MCP integration by testing GitHub context retrieval.

### **Hours 20-24: Demo Preparation & Documentation**
- Prepare a demo showcasing key functionalities (search, map, calendar sync, and multimodal inputs).
- Document the project, including setup instructions, known limitations, and future enhancements.
- Create a brief presentation or video walkthrough for the hackathon.
